## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# libraries
library(dplyr)
library(lattice)
## import data
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv",header = TRUE)
```

** Number of Steps per day **

```{r histogram1, echo=TRUE, fig.width=10, warning = FALSE}
### calulate steps per day
steps_by_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity, sum)
### create a histagram
hist(steps_by_day$steps, xlab= "Total Number of steps per day", ylab = "Number of Days", main = "Total Number of Steps taken each day")
```

** Calculate mean and median number of steps taken per day **
```{r echo = TRUE}
mean_raw <- mean(steps_by_day$steps)
median_raw <- median(steps_by_day$steps)
```

** Average of daily activity pattern **

``` {r timeplot1, echo = TRUE, fig.width =10, warning = FALSE}
averStepsbyInt <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activity, mean)
with(averStepsbyInt, plot(interval, steps, type = "l"))
```

** 5 minute interval (on average across all the days) with the maximum number of steps **

``` {r echo = TRUE, fig.width = 10, warning = FALSE}
averStepsbyInt[which.max(averStepsbyInt[,2]), 1]
```

** Inputing missing values **

``` {r echo = TRUE}
### Total number of missing values in the dataset ###
missingindex <- is.na(activity[,1])
m <- mean(averStepsbyInt$steps)
```

``` {r echo = TRUE}
### creating new dataset with all missing values included in the original dataset ###
activity1 <- activity
activity1[missingindex, 1] <- m
head(activity1)
```

** Creating a histagram with the total number of steps taken each day with missing data filled in **

``` {r histogram2, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 10, warning = FALSE}
totalstepsDay1 <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity1, sum)
hist(totalstepsDay1$steps, xlab = "Total Number of Steps per Day", ylab = "Number of Days", main = "Number of Steps per day after missing values are input")
```

** Calculating and reporting the mean and median total number of steps taken per day **

``` {r echo = TRUE}
mean_afterInput <- mean(totalstepsDay1$steps)
median_afterInput <- median(totalstepsDay1$steps)
```

** Differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends **

``` {r echo = TRUE}
activity1$date <- as.Date(activity1$date)
activity2 <- activity1%>%
  mutate(dayType = ifelse(weekdays(activity1$date)== "Saturday" | weekdays(activity1$date)== "Sunday", "Weekend", "Weekday"))
head(activity2)

averStepsByDTandInter <- activity2 %>%
  group_by(dayType, interval) %>%
  summarize(averStepsbyDay = sum(steps))

head(averStepsByDTandInter)
```

** Create two time series plot of the 5 minute interval and the average number of steps taken across weekdays or weekend days **

``` {r timeplot2, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 10, warning = FALSE}
with(averStepsByDTandInter,
     xyplot(averStepsbyDay ~ interval | dayType,
            type = "l",
            main = "Total Number of Steps within Intervals by dayType",
            xlab = "Daily Intervals",
            ylab = "Average Number of Steps"))
```
